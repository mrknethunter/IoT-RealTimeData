# IoT-RealTimeData
ETL data pipeline to analyze real time data from Smart Energy Meter to analyze and optimize electricity consumption in residential contexts.

In particular, I'm working with an energy meter that uses the NB-IoT wireless communication standard and I'll do also some security-related considerations on it.
